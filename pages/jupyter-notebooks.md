# Short Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

## What is Notebooks?

Jupyter Notebooks

Computational notebooks (also called "Notebook Interfaces") have existed for decades, and were created to let users to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. They became popular among researchers for allowing them to annotate procedue, data and findings, making it easier for them to later reproduce calculations with different data.

Jupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity in the past years, becoming by far the most used computational notebook. 

## How to open a Jupyter notebook

Do we need to explain how it is a command line that creates a server on your local computer? Perhaps too advanced? (Remember, we want to keep these short and navigable.)

## Choosing, Starting, and Restarting a kernel

...and explaining briefly what a kernel is. Also to include here: persistence between cells (i.e. as long as the kernel isn't restarted, all of the state—variables, imports, etc—remains).

## Running a cell

What is a cell, and how does one best run it? (button and <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>
